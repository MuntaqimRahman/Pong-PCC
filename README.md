# Pong-PCC
A c# Pong Clone with single player and local multiplayer

Some test code testing the yPrediction method in the Ball class is in the test information folder. The actual test code is in the Ball.cs 
file in that folder. I hope to expand the testing algorithmms to test more units with greater scrutiny.

The source code is both in the "Source Code" folder and the "My Code" folder, the difference being whether or not it includes Visual Studio
generated code which deals with backend creation of the form and other lower-level tasks. The high-level logic and display code was all 
written by me and can be found in both folders. However the "My Code" folder contains this code exclusively.

To run the program, you can install the clickonce application or just run the .exe file. Both can be found in the "publish" folder. All
controls and instructions for the game can be opened from the game menu once the application is run. I hope you enjoy looking through
the code.

2/06/2019 Update: Expanded ball test and readded publish file - changes window size on some computers and readding was used to check for the problem, the problem remains and needs to be assessed in the future
